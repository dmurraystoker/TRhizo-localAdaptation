## Workflow

The `data_analysis` folder is organized into 9 subfolders in the order in which analyses were completed. Additional README files are provided in select folders where multiple scripts files were created to completed the analyses.

Here is a brief summary of the code:

* 1-microbiome_x_nitrogen-model_fitting = code and workspaces for the model selection and optimization procedure.
* 2-microbiome_x_nitrogen-analyses = code and workspace for all linear mixed-effects models following the model selection procedure.
* 3-cockerhams_test = code and workspace to complete Cockerhams' test; note that some data formatting was performed in Excel.
* 4-local_adaptation_indices = calculates all local adaptation indices.
* 5-local_adaptation_index_correlations = calculates all correlations between fitness response variables.
* 6-local_adaptation_by_urbanization = linear regressions of local adaptation indices against measures of urbanization.
* 7-DADA2_pipeline = code to complete the DADA2 pipeline, with sequences available through NCBI.
* 8-microbiome_analyses = code and workspace for all microbiome analyses
* 9-figures = code to generate all the figures in the manuscript; minor edits were made using Adobe Illustrator.
