## Workflow

All analyses can be conducted by running the `microbiome_analyses.Rmd` script.

ASV taxonomy and abundance tables are provided to facilitate the analyses. They were exported from the `DADA2_pipeline.Rmd` script and are needed to create the `phyloseq` and `tidyamplicons` objects used in the analyses.
